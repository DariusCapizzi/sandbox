# Sandbox

This website allows a user to manipulate images with tools, like a rudimentary Adobe Photoshop.

By Josh Bertsche, Kate Hall, Darius Capizzi, and Catherine Karra

## Description

The user can upload images and use our 8 tool buttons to change their images. When the user uploads an image, they must click on the image to select it, then they can start applying tool styles. The user can also deselect an image by clicking on it a second time. The buttons we offer the user are: rotate, which allows for a clockwise rotation of images; scale up and scale down, to increase and decrease the sizes of images; opacity, to make images more transparent; blur, to make images fuzzier; sepia, to make images appear beige and old-timey; invert to turn images upside-down; and delete to delete images. The rotate, opacity, blur, sepia, and invert buttons will reset once the user has clicked the buttons the number of times their cycles allow. The scale up button enables infinite scaling up, and the scale down button enables the user to scale down until the image disappears.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Open up a web browser
* Enter url jbertsche.github.io/sandbox/
* Upload an image or two, drag the images anywhere on the screen, select the images you want to edit, and use the tool buttons to change the images

## Known Bugs

We had a join function in the works to join images, drag them together, and apply the same styles to. However, join was conflicting with our other toolbar buttons, so we took that button off the toolbar. We also worked on making a server to which we could save images, but we didn't finish it.
